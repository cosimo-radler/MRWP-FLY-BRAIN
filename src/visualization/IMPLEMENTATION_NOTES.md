# Dashboard Implementation Notes

## Design Choices

The interactive dashboard for network model comparison was implemented using Plotly Dash for several key reasons:

1. **Native Python Integration:** Dash is built on top of Plotly and Flask, allowing us to create the dashboard entirely in Python without needing JavaScript/HTML/CSS expertise. This ensures compatibility with our existing Python codebase.

2. **Interactivity:** Dash provides reactive components that update automatically based on user input, enabling real-time toggling of different models and network types.

3. **Scientific Data Visualization:** Plotly's plotting capabilities are well-suited for scientific data visualization, particularly for log-scale plots and network metrics.

4. **Local Hosting:** The dashboard runs locally via Flask, requiring no external server setup, making it easy for researchers to run on their own machines.

5. **Bootstrap Integration:** Using dash-bootstrap-components provides a responsive layout that works well on different screen sizes.

## Architecture

The dashboard follows a modular architecture:

1. **Data Loading Functions:** Adapted from the original visualization script to load networks and results files.

2. **Visualization Functions:** Create Plotly figures for different visualization types (degree distributions, percolation, attacks).

3. **Layout:** Organized in tabs for different visualization types, with global controls for network selection and model toggling.

4. **Callbacks:** React to user input to update visualizations dynamically.

## Performance Considerations

Several optimizations were implemented to ensure good performance:

1. **Lazy Loading:** Networks and results are loaded only when needed for a specific visualization.

2. **Caching:** Future versions could implement caching of loaded networks and computed metrics to improve responsiveness.

3. **Efficient Plotting:** Using Plotly's efficient graph objects rather than more resource-intensive approaches.

## Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for future versions:

1. **Network Visualization:** Add actual network visualizations with node layout based on graph structure.

2. **Statistical Comparisons:** Add statistical tests to quantify similarities between models.

3. **Export Functionality:** Allow users to export visualizations and data in various formats.

4. **3D Visualizations:** Add 3D network visualizations for more detailed structural analysis.

5. **Deployed Version:** Host the dashboard on a server for broader access.

## Technical Notes

- The dashboard inherits paths and constants from the original visualization script to maintain compatibility.
- Error handling is implemented to gracefully handle missing data files.
- The dashboard uses a responsive design approach to work well on different devices.
